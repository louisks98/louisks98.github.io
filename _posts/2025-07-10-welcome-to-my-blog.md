I wanted a place where I could show and have some concrete proof of my projects' progress. I had no desire to publish my thoughts on traditional social media, which are quite restrictive and not suited to the type of content I wanted to create. I also wanted to apply a certain personal touch to the appearance of this space, which isn't really possible on TikTok, Instagram, X, etc.

So, what could be better than a good old blog!

Don't expect to see exceptional or even interesting posts. I will simply be posting the progression of my current projects and demonstrating the knowledge I've acquired.
